# Netup

Netup resets the network-manager by the choice of three different options.
I wrote this script for cases where your network-manager decides not to work or turns off by itself,thus not allowing wifi to work.
All three options work just the same yet different for some systems. Tested on majority of debian and arch systems.
Added install script to add netup to /usr/lcoal/bin for ease of use.
